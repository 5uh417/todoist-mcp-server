## Planning Questions
1. What are your top 3 priorities for today?
2. Which tasks can be completed quickly (< 15 minutes)?
3. Are there any tasks that should be rescheduled or delegated?
4. What new tasks need to be added for today?

Please help me prioritize and organize these tasks for maximum productivity."""

## Original Task
{task_description}

## Breakdown Framework
Please help me break down this task into smaller, actionable steps:

1. **Identify Components**: What are the main parts of this task?
2. **Sequence Steps**: What order should these be completed in?
3. **Estimate Time**: How long might each step take?
4. **Identify Dependencies**: What needs to be done before other steps?
5. **Define Success**: What does completion look like for each step?

## Output Format
Please provide:
- A list of 3-7 concrete, actionable subtasks
- Time estimates for each subtask
- Any dependencies between subtasks
- Priority level for each subtask

This breakdown will help me create individual tasks in Todoist for better tracking and completion."""

## Review Questions

### Completion Analysis
1. What tasks did I complete this week?
2. What tasks are still pending and why?
3. Which projects made the most progress?

### Process Improvement
1. What patterns do I notice in my task completion?
2. Are there tasks that consistently get postponed?
3. How can I better estimate task duration?

### Planning Ahead
1. What are the priorities for next week?
2. Are there any upcoming deadlines I need to prepare for?
3. Should any projects be restructured or broken down differently?
