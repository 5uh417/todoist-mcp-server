## Project Setup Framework
Since this is a new project, let's plan it thoroughly:

### 1. Project Definition
- What is the main goal of this project?
- What does success look like?
- What is the expected timeline?

### 2. Task Breakdown
- What are the major phases or milestones?
- What specific tasks need to be completed?
- What is the logical sequence of tasks?

### 3. Resource Planning
- What resources (time, tools, people) are needed?
- Are there any external dependencies?
- What is the priority level of this project?

### 4. Implementation Strategy
- What tasks should be created first?
- How should tasks be prioritized?
- What labels or due dates should be applied?

Please help me structure this project with specific, actionable tasks that can be created in Todoist."""
